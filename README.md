This repository consists of my student projects
Summary of project prompts as follows:

**FoA_project1:**
  Summary: identify the genes that have mutated in the variant of a virus comparing with the reference virus of an isolated DNA sequence \n 
  Learning outcomes: arrays, pointers, input processing, and functions. \n
  language : C \n

**FoA_project2:**
  Summary: Data mining to give restaurant recommendations from a dataset.
  Learning outcomes: understanding of dynamic memory allocation, linked data structures, and search algorithms.
  language : C
**elements_of_data_processing_P1**
  Summary: Process and analyse different news sources for their reliability.
  Learning outcomes: dealing with different files, data processing, visualization and analysis in python
  language : Python

**Algorithms_and_data_Structures_P1**
  Summary: create a simple dictionary based on a linked list to store information from a dataset about the City of Melbourne. A user will be able to search this dictionary to retrieve information about footpaths in Melbourne using attributes in the dataset. We search and output records that match with the key.
  Learning outcome: linkedlists, data cleaning
  language: C

**Algorithms_and_data_Structures_P2**
  Summary:  implementation of a PR quadtree has to support a number of functions to store data points and to search for them. You will need to implement functions to support inserting data points, searching for individual datapoints and searching (returning) for all datapoints within a query rectangle. Queryies include insertion, Search, and range query 
  Learning outcome: Complex data structures such as trees, pointers handling
  language: C
**Algorithms_and_data_Structures_P3**
  Summary: build a solver for the free flow problem. We also need to control the branching factor and the search depth to be able to solve the problem in limited time and space
  Learning outcome: Graphs, Search Algorithms
  language: C
